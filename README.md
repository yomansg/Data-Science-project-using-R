# Data Science project using R

Hi everyone!
I am a Data analytics professional. I was doing some further upskilling by attending a Data Science programme last year, and have done a Capstone project with a fellow course-mate. Happy to share with everyone what we have done.

We used R to investigate the factors influencing view-completion rates of streamed shows.
Dataset is from Kaggle; applied the usual Data Science workflow:
  Import -> Tidy and Transform -> Visualise our Data -> Model -> Interpret Results
